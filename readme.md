# BusLink Backend
It is a multiplatform system for the administration and purchase of travel tickets for bus land terminals. In this system as administrator we can manage the cooperatives and their buses, the users of the system, and assign the frequencies to be used by the registered cooperatives. As administrator users of each cooperative we will be able to make ticket sales. As a customer I can make reservations in the web application or the mobile application.
